// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Variable is (number), range(x)
Use % 2 to check if number is even or odd
if the return of (value) % 2 is 0 print "even"
if the return of (value) % 2 is greater than 0 print "odd"

ex.

for number in range(17):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print("even")
        continue

    if number % 2 > 0:
        print("odd")
        continue


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A) Enter 5 numbers to be used  
 	Read n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

B) Average is sum of (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 
	assign sum to (average)
	
C) Use function min(n1-n5) to determine smallest number and assign it to (minimum)
		max(n1-n5) to determine largest and assign it to (maximum)

D) Print "The Average is (average)"
   Print "The Mininum is (minimum)"
   Print "The Maximum is (mamixmum)"
